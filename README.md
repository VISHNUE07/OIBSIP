# Data Science Internship Projects - Oasis Infobyte
--------
## Overview
This repository contains projects completed as part of my Data Science internship at Oasis Infobyte. The projects cover a range of machine learning tasks, including Email Spam Detection, Car Price Prediction, and Sales Prediction. Each project employs a variety of machine learning models and methods to solve real-world problems.

## Projects
### 1. Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
#### Objective: Build a model to detect spam emails based on the email content.

#### Models Used: 
* Logistic Regression 
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* AdaBoost Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* XGBoost Classifier

#### Methods:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, text vectorization (TF-IDF), and stop-word removal, were used to process the text data.
The models were evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and Confusion Matrix.

#### Technologies Used: 
* Python, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib

### 2. Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
#### Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on attributes like year, fuel type, transmission, owner type, selling type and kilometers driven.

#### Models Used: 
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Lasso Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Gradient Boosting
  
#### Methods:
Performed feature engineering and data preprocessing to handle missing values, duplicate values and outliers.
Evaluated models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score to determine the most accurate model for price prediction.
#### Technologies Used: 
* Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 3. Sales Prediction Using Python
#### Objective: Create a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical data.

#### Models Used: 
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* Lasso Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Gradient Boosting
#### Methods:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand seasonal patterns and trends in the sales data.
Compared regression models to predict future sales, using evaluation metrics such as RMSE, and R² score to identify the best-performing model.
#### Technologies Used: 
* Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Results
Each project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning for its respective task:

* Email Spam Detection: Achieved high accuracy in spam classification, showcasing the power of machine learning in text classification tasks.
* Car Price Prediction: Accurate car price predictions with low error rates, useful for pricing strategies in the automotive industry.
* Sales Prediction: Reliable sales forecasts that help in understanding trends and planning for future demand.

### Conclusion
These projects highlight my skills in data science, machine learning, and data visualization. This repository serves as a demonstration of my ability to apply machine learning models to solve practical business problems.
